   Analysis of pollution levels in India
................................................

This project contains detailed analysis of Air Pollution Levels in India and aims to use data mining techniques to accomplish the following:
1. To find trends in the Air Pollution levels in various states of India over the
years 2005 − 2014.
2. To find the most polluted states in India with respect to SO2, NO2 and RSPM
concentrations.
3. To find the hotpots and coldspots of Air Pollution by comparing the Pollution
levels in each state with it’s neighboring states using z-score and to classify
the states as outliers and non-outliers using chi-score.
4. To find a correlation between the trends in Air Pollution of each state with
these possible factors- Number of Vehicles in the state, Number of Factories
operating in the state and Population Density of the state.
5. To cluster the states based on their pollution levels.
